That's a unique combination! Here's an idea for a CNN project combining those elements:

**Project Name:** `BorboletaVision` (Portuguese for "Butterfly Vision")

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically for identifying and classifying butterfly species found in Brazil. The application will feature a Raku-based backend for data processing and model management, and it will be released under a suitable open-source license.

## Overview

`BorboletaVision` is designed to assist entomologists, conservationists, and nature enthusiasts in identifying Brazilian butterfly species from images. Brazil is home to an incredible diversity of butterflies, and an automated identification system can significantly aid research and conservation efforts. The project will leverage the expressive power of Raku for its core logic, data handling, and potentially parts of the CNN architecture definition.

## Features

*   **Butterfly Species Classification:** Identifies various Brazilian butterfly species from uploaded images.
*   **CNN Model:** Utilizes a custom or pre-trained CNN architecture fine-tuned for butterfly recognition.
*   **Raku Backend:** Robust data processing, model loading, and prediction serving implemented in Raku.
*   **Web/Desktop Interface:** (Future consideration) A user-friendly interface to upload images and get predictions.
*   **Dataset Management:** Tools for managing and augmenting the Brazilian butterfly image dataset.
*   **Open-Source:** Released under an open-source license to encourage collaboration and wider use.

## Technologies Used

*   **Raku:** Primary language for backend logic, data pipelining, and potentially interfacing with machine learning libraries. Raku's concurrency features and powerful regex capabilities could be beneficial for image metadata processing.
*   **TensorFlow/PyTorch (via Raku bindings or interop):** For building and training the CNN model. While Raku's ML ecosystem is growing, it might interface with established Python-based libraries for the heavy lifting of neural network computation.
*   **Image Processing Libraries:** For image augmentation, preprocessing, and feature extraction (e.g., OpenCV, or Raku's own image modules).

## Dataset

The core of `BorboletaVision` relies on a comprehensive dataset of Brazilian butterfly species. This dataset will ideally include:

*   **Images:** High-resolution images of various butterfly species, captured from different angles and lighting conditions.
*   **Annotations:** Species labels for each image, including scientific and common names.
*   **Metadata:** Geographic location of observation, date, photographer, and other relevant information.

Examples of Brazilian butterfly species that would be included in the dataset:

*   *Morpho menelaus* (Blue Morpho)
*   *Heliconius erato* (Red Postman)
*   *Papilio thoas* (King Swallowtail)
*   *Dryas iulia* (Julia Butterfly)
*   *Caligo eurilochus* (Forest Giant Owl)

Here's an illustrative image of a Brazilian butterfly, a Morpho Menelaus, which would be part of such a dataset:
